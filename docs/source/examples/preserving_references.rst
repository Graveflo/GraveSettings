aPreserving References
======================







Not Preserving References
==========================

Now lets say that you have two objects that reference two two separately identical objects. With one list you want to preserve the reference but with the other you do not. How to we accomplish this?

blah blah blah


Be careful wrapping anything in a Temporary object, though. Temporary objects primary use is to instruct the formatter that the object does not actually belong to the user's object hierarchy.

# todo: add a part in the Formatters documentation that details the need to manipulate the MroHandler to deal with NoRefs and Temporary independently
